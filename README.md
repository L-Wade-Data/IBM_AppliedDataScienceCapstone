This project is centred around analysing the data from SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches. The goal is to gain insights that can inform future launch strategies, contribute to improvements in launch success rates, and ultimately support SpaceX's mission to advance space exploration.

Summary of Methodologies: 
- This project employed a comprehensive methodology that included data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visual analytics, and predictive analysis. 
1. Data Collection: Utilised the SpaceX API and Wikipedia web scraping to gather comprehensive data on SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches.
2. Data Wrangling: The collected data was cleaned and processed to ensure it was ready for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth EDA using visualisation tools and SQL to understand the underlying structure of the data and identify patterns.
4. Interactive Visual Analytics: Created interactive visualisations and dashboards using Folium and Plotly Dash for dynamic exploration of the data.
5. Predictive Analysis: Built, tuned, and evaluated various classification models to predict the outcome of future launches.

Summary of Results: 
- The results of the analysis revealed key insights about SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches. 
1. EDA Results: Found that the success rate of launches increased over time, certain launch sites were preferred for heavier payloads, and specific orbit types had higher success rates.
2. Interactive Analytics Results: Provided dynamic and accessible insights into the data, enhancing the understanding of the launch data.
3. Predictive Analysis Results: Identified the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model as the most accurate in predicting the outcome of future launches.

Conclusion: 
- The combination of these methodologies provided a comprehensive understanding of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches. The insights gained from this analysis could inform future launch strategies, contribute to improvements in launch success rates, and ultimately support SpaceX's mission to advance space exploration.
